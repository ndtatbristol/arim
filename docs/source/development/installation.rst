Create a new virtual environment::

  conda create -n arim-dev python=3.5

Activate the environment::

  # On Windows:
  activate arim-dev

  # On Unix:
  source activate arim-dev

Install dependencies::

  conda install numpy scipy matplotlib h5py numba sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme cython

Then install arim in editable mode::

  # check you are in the directory containing file setup.py
  pip install -e .

Then :doc:`build the library <building>` and finally :ref:`check all tests pass <run_tests>`.

*Optional:* if you intend to build conda packages, install in root environment the package conda-build::

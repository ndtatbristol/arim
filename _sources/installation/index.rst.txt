Requirements
------------

arim has the following requirements:

- Python 3
- `numpy <https://www.numpy.org/>`_
- `scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_
- `numba <https://numba.pydata.org/>`_: efficient computation
- `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_: plotting library used in :mod:`arim.plot` and in scripts
- `pyyaml <https://pyyaml.org/>`_: reading configuration files

The following dependencies are needed for the example scripts, although they may not be directly used in arim:

- `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_: data analysis tools
- `pooch <https://www.fatiando.org/pooch/latest/>`_: for downloading data files

Finally, some users may require the following package:

Installation (stable)
---------------------

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Anaconda

        Make sure you have a working `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_ installation with Python v3.9 or greater.

        Anaconda will already have many requirements already installed, however you may have to install ...

        From the `arim releases page <https://github.com/ndtatbristol/arim/releases>`_, download the most recent wheel package
        (``*.whl`` file).

        Open the Anaconda Prompt, navigate to the directory where the wheel file was downloaded, and install this file

        .. code-block:: shell

            cd <download-directory>
            pip install <arim-wheel-file>

        For the most recent version, this is

        .. code-block:: shell

            cd <download-directory>
            pip install arim-0.9-py3-none-any.whl


    .. tab-item:: Conda / mamba environment
        :name: conda-env

        Make sure you have a working `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html>`_
        or `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html>`_ installation. Note that
        for the remainder of this section the `conda` command will be used - this may be replaced with `mamba` if this is
        your package manager.

        Open the Anaconda Prompt or Miniforge Prompt, and create a new environment with the required packages installed

        .. code-block:: shell

            conda create -n <env-name> numpy scipy numba matplotlib pyyaml pandas pooch h5py

        Activate this new environment

        .. code-block:: shell

            conda activate <env-name>

        From the `arim releases page <https://github.com/ndtatbristol/arim/releases>`_, download the most recent wheel
        package (``*.whl`` file).

        In the prompt, navigate to the directory where the wheel file was downloaded, and install this file

        .. code-block:: shell

            cd <download-directory>
            pip install <arim-wheel-file>

        For the most recent version, this is

        .. code-block:: shell

            cd <download-directory>
            pip install <arim-wheel-file>


arim will now be installed in your environment. Verify your installation

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import arim
    >>> print(arim.__version__)


Installation (latest)
---------------------

Make sure you have a working installation of Anaconda, Conda or Mamba. Make sure that your desired environment is

arim is a Python library for the modelling and imaging of ultrasonic inspections for nondestructive testing.

Features currently include:

- Ray-based forward modelling for contact and immersion inspections in 2D.
- Imaging via the total focusing method (TFM) and multi-view TFM for contact and immersion inspections.
